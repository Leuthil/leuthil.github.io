Stay afloat in an abstract future by powering up.

## Development ##

I developed this game solo to test and see how polished of a game I could come up with within the 3-day deadline. Having recently been into roguelike indie games, I decided to try my hand at one, but also while respecting the jam's theme of Unstable. I thought having a roguelike based on an unstable ground might be interesting.
